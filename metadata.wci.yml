headline: Robust, flexible and resource-efficient pipelines using Go and the commandline.

description: SciPipe is a library for writing Scientific Workflows, sometimes
  also called "pipelines", in the Go programming language. When you need to run
  many commandline programs that depend on each other in complex ways, SciPipe
  helps by making the process of running these programs flexible, robust and
  reproducible. SciPipe also lets you restart an interrupted run without
  over-writing already produced output and produces an audit report of what was
  run, among many other things.
